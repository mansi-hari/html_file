    <h1>Here are some additional tips for choosing nursery flowers:  </h1>       
<h3>
<li>Make sure the flowers are non-toxic.</li>
<li> There are many common flowers that are poisonous to children, so it's important to do your research before planting anything.</li>
<li> Choose flowers that are easy to care for. You don't want to spend a lot of time watering and feeding your flowers, so choose varieties that are drought-tolerant and low-maintenance.</li>
<li>Select flowers that bloom at different times of year. This will help to ensure that your nursery has color all season long.
</li>
